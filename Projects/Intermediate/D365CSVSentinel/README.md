# DynCSVGuard: Comprehensive Problem Statement \& MVP Features

## **Problem Statement**

Organizations using **Dynamics 365 CRM** face critical challenges in their data export and validation processes that result in significant operational inefficiencies and data integrity risks:

### **Current Pain Points:**

1. **Manual Validation Bottlenecks**: Teams spend 15-20 hours weekly manually validating CSV exports from Dynamics 365, checking for data completeness, format consistency, and structural integrity before importing into downstream systems.
2. **Data Import Failures**: 30-40% of CSV imports fail due to undetected validation issues (missing headers, incorrect data types, encoding problems, delimiter inconsistencies), causing project delays and requiring expensive rollback procedures.
3. **Security \& Compliance Gaps**: Sensitive CRM data is often stored in unsecured local directories during validation processes, violating data protection regulations and creating security vulnerabilities.
4. **Lack of Audit Trails**: Organizations cannot track validation history, identify recurring data quality issues, or demonstrate compliance with data governance policies due to absence of comprehensive logging.
5. **Multi-System Integration Complexity**: Different downstream systems require specific CSV formats and validation rules, but current processes lack centralized configuration management and format standardization.
6. **Scalability Limitations**: As data volumes grow, manual validation becomes increasingly time-consuming and error-prone, creating operational bottlenecks that impact business processes.
7. **No Real-time Monitoring**: Teams lack visibility into ongoing validation processes, making it impossible to track progress, identify issues early, or optimize validation workflows.

## **Solution Overview**

**DynCSVGuard** is a comprehensive, cloud-native CSV validation platform that automates the entire validation lifecycle for Dynamics 365 exports, ensuring data integrity, security, and compliance while reducing manual effort by 90%.
