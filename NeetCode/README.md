# Revision of DSA

---

I will explain here how you can make use of this repository in the most productive way.
- Refer the roadmap [here](https://neetcode.io/roadmap) if you are a beginner. If you are not beginner you can pick any topic of your choice.
- Start the topics in the same way as mentioned in the Roadmap.
- Pick the question. Apply your logic first. If no success then see the solution and try to understand each step on why was it done.
- Use the Main.java as a playground to run all your programs. You can use it to call the pre-created functions to see if the solution works or not. 
- Raise any PR for any issues you see.
